# PG3D-Gameguardian-script
I have decided to put this menu as a open source and im taking a break from modding pg3d, you're free to edit this script as much as you want
you can use this and showcase it on your YouTube I do not care

you will need to dump the game to get the offset functions however 

FOR PC: you can use il2cpp dumper here https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper
FOR MOBILE: https://il2cppdumper.com/ 

also becareful because cubicgames is starting to tackle mod menu videos
